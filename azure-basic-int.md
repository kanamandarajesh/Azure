### **General Azure Questions**  

1. **What is Microsoft Azure?**  
   **Azure** is a cloud computing platform by Microsoft that provides services like virtual machines, databases, networking, and storage. It allows businesses to build, deploy, and manage applications efficiently.  

2. **What are the benefits of using Azure?**  
   - Scalability  
   - Cost-effectiveness (pay-as-you-go model)  
   - High availability  
   - Security and compliance  
   - Global reach (available in multiple regions)  

3. **What are the different types of cloud computing models?**  
   - **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** – Provides virtualized computing resources (e.g., Azure VMs, Azure Virtual Network).  
   - **PaaS (Platform as a Service)** – Provides a managed platform for development and deployment (e.g., Azure App Service, Azure SQL Database).  
   - **SaaS (Software as a Service)** – Provides software applications over the internet (e.g., Microsoft 365, Azure DevOps).  

4. **What are Azure Regions and Availability Zones?**  
   - **Azure Regions**: Physical locations worldwide where Azure services are available (e.g., East US, West Europe).  
   - **Availability Zones**: Separate datacenters within a region that offer redundancy to ensure high availability.  

5. **What is the difference between a Resource Group and a Subscription?**  
   - **Subscription**: The top-level container for Azure resources, linked to billing.  
   - **Resource Group**: A logical container that holds related Azure resources for better management and organization.

### **Azure Services & Components**  

6. **What is Azure Virtual Machine (VM)?**  
   Azure VM is an IaaS service that provides on-demand computing power, allowing users to run applications and workloads on virtualized hardware.  

7. **What is Azure App Service?**  
   Azure App Service is a PaaS offering that enables developers to build, deploy, and scale web apps and APIs without managing the underlying infrastructure.  

8. **What is Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)?**  
   AKS is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications in Azure.  

9. **What is Azure Blob Storage?**  
   Azure Blob Storage is an object storage solution for storing unstructured data like images, videos, and documents.  

10. **What is the difference between Azure SQL Database and SQL Server on Azure VM?**  
   - **Azure SQL Database**: A fully managed PaaS database service with automatic backups, updates, and scaling.  
   - **SQL Server on Azure VM**: A self-managed IaaS option where users have full control over SQL Server but need to handle maintenance.  

11. **What is Azure Virtual Network (VNet)?**  
   Azure VNet is a networking service that allows users to create isolated networks in Azure, connecting VMs and other resources securely.  

12. **What is Azure Load Balancer?**  
   Azure Load Balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple VMs to ensure high availability and reliability.

### **Security & Identity**  

13. **What is Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)?**  
   Azure AD is Microsoft’s cloud-based identity and access management service that helps secure user authentication for apps and services.  

14. **What is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Azure?**  
   RBAC is a security model that controls who has access to Azure resources and what actions they can perform.  

15. **What is Azure Key Vault?**  
   Azure Key Vault is a cloud service for securely storing and managing secrets, encryption keys, and certificates.

### **Azure DevOps & Automation**  

16. **What is Azure DevOps?**  
   Azure DevOps is a set of development tools for planning, developing, testing, and deploying applications using CI/CD pipelines.  

17. **How does Azure Resource Manager (ARM) work?**  
   ARM is the deployment and management service for Azure, enabling users to create, update, and manage resources using templates.  

18. **What are ARM Templates?**  
   ARM Templates are JSON files that define Azure resources and configurations for automated deployment.  

19. **What is Terraform, and how does it work with Azure?**  
   Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows users to provision and manage Azure resources using declarative configuration files.

### **Networking & Security**  

20. **What is an NSG (Network Security Group) in Azure?**  
   An NSG is a security rule set that controls inbound and outbound traffic to Azure VMs and subnets.  

21. **What is an Application Gateway in Azure?**  
   Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that provides routing, SSL termination, and security features like Web Application Firewall (WAF).  

22. **What is Azure Firewall?**  
   Azure Firewall is a managed security service that protects Azure resources from threats by filtering traffic.
